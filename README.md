 HTML WORKING WITH GRAPHICS AND IMAGES

 IMAGES
 <UL>
     <li>Source attribute(src): Tells the browser which image file to load.</li>
     <li>Alt attribute(alt): Provides a text description of the image.</li>
     <li>Alt attribute: Serve as a replacement for the image when it can not be seen.</li>
     <li>Width & Height: Size of the image.</li>
 </UL>
 Image Formats
 <ul>
     <li>Aims for highest possible quality with the smallest file size.</li>
     <li>GIF:Graphics Interchange Format</li>
     -Compressing illustractions that have large areas of the same color.
     <li>SVG:Scalable Vector Graphics</li>
     -Contains instructions for drawing rather than individual pixel.
     <li>JPG:Joint Photographic Expert Group</li>
     -Compressing photographs
     -Can be compressed further by reducing color information, finding the right balance between quality and file size.
     <li>PNG:Portable Network Graphics</li>
     -Newer format that works well when you need transparency in a photograph.
     -It outperforms GIF and JPG in compressing certain types of images.
 </ul>
<ul>
    <li>Responsive Image</li>
    -They automatically adjust to fit the size of the screen.
    <li>Responsive Width</li>
    -Demostrate how the source attribute set in the sizes attribute can be utilized to offer multiple image files to the browser.
    <li>Figcaption and Figures</li>
    -"<figcaption>"defines a caption for a "<figure>"element
    <li>"<figcaption>"element can be placed as the first or last child of the "<figure>" element</li>
    - It supports global attributes in html.
    <li>"<figur>" specifies self-contained content like photos, diagrams and more.</li>
    <li>It relates to the main flow</li>
    <li>It's position is independent of the main flow</li>
    <li>If removed it will not affect the flow of the document.</li>
    <li>It supports global attributes in html.</li>
</ul> 
Working with Media
        <ul>      
<li>Multimedia comes in many different formats. It can be almost anything you can hear or see, like images, music, sound, videos, records, films, animations, and more.</li>
<li>Working with Audio</li>
<li>You can use JavaScript and the HTML media element API to develop your own custom audio player controls rather than depending on pre-built ones.</li>
<li>We will not implement that for this example; instead, we will only add the "controls" attribute.</li>
<li>Then attributes indicate that we want the controls if they are there.</li>
<li>The website now features an audio player.</li>
<li>We'll be able to view the time, play, pause, mute, and explore the timeline thanks to this.</li>
        </ul>
Working with Video
        <ul>
<li> The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.</li>
<li> It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.</li>
<li> The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.</li>
        </ul>
        
 HTML Language Support
 <ul>
<li>The lang attribute is used to specify the language of a webpage and If the whole page is in one language, it is quite simple.</li>
<li>Set the language on the main element that wraps everything else, which is usually the HTML element.</li>
<li>In HTML, it's good to have a lang attribute in <html>, e.g. <html lang="en">.</li>
 </ul>
 
Working with the lang and charset attributes
 <ul>
<li>Most languages flow from left to right horizontally, but some flow from right to left. Use the dir attribute to indicate the direction, and it can be applied to any element.</li>
<li>It is helpful when the content on your page goes to same direction you just define it once on the outer HTML element</li>
<li><html lang =”en-US”>  and "<html lang =”en-BS”>"in this example the content is Engish in United state and Great British</li>
<li>"<html la>ng =”en-US” dir=”ltr”>"  and "<html lang =”en-BS” ” dir=”rtl”>" this one shows that en-gb is from right to left and other one vice verse.</li>
 </ul>

The Meta Attribute
<ul>
<li>The meta tag defines the metadata about the HTML document while metadata is information about data</li>
<li><meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.</li>
<li>There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport</li>
<li>To specify the charset in HTML, simply include a meta charset tag that equals UTF-8.</li>
</ul> 
    
 HTML Generic Elements, Div and Span
 <ul>
<li>There two elements such as div which is used to create sidebars and sections .</li>
<li>Also div is a block level element  and they are usually used a lot in javascript and CSS</li>
<li>Span is used to mark desired phrase and they can make use of various global attribute</li>
 </ul>
 HTML INTEGRATION 
 <ul>
     <li>It is important because it lets developers organize content and make it easy to interact with on web pages.</li>
 </ul>
HTML PAGE
<ul>
<li>File should begin with a doctype statement.</li>
<li><!doctype>: helps browsers to display web pages correctly.</li>
<li>After doctype statement, we enclose everything inside html element (<html><?html>).</li>
<li>Inside html element, there are 2 main parts (HEAD AND BODY)</li>
<li>All these are essential building blocks of every web page.</li>
</ul>
DOCUMENT HEAD
    <ul>
<li>Character set: “UTF-8”</li>
<li>Specified in the <meta> tag</li>
<li>Ensure meta elements are only placed inside the head as they provide metadata about the page.</li>
<li>Link element- Serve to connect various assets that should be load.</li>
    </ul>
SCRIPT ELEMENT
    <ul>
        <li>Script tag- instructs the browser to load javascript file.</li>
        <li>It is places at the end of the doc.</li>
    </ul>
    
CONTENT STRUCTURING<br>
Six important elements
<ol>
    <li>Main</li>
    <li>Header</li>
    <li>Footer</li>
    <li>Article</li>
    <li>Section</li>
    <li>Aside</li>
</ol>
